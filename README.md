# vue-skills

This is a sample App created to understand basics of VueJS. It has comments at 
relevant places so that it becomes easy for me in future to understand what part 
does what!

This app allows to add a skill and remove skill from list. Things covered in the
app are:
1. How to use Routers
2. How to use Scoped CSS
3. Important VueJS Directives like: v-if, v-for, v-bind etc.
4. Using Transitions
5. Handling Forms and Validations
